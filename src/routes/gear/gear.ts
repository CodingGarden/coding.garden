				'This is a separate dedicated desktop computer for streaming. This computer takes in all of the audio/video signals (laptop HDMI, microphone audio, laptop audio etc.) and outputs the composite stream to twitch using OBS. It is not necessary to use a separate computer for this, but it prevents my coding laptop fans from spinning up, and is a nice fail safe to keep the stream up if something happens to my coding laptop during the stream.',
